## Description

In this game it is the goal to collect ingredients for cookies. When you have enough 
ingredients you are able to bake a cookie and unlock a level. Next to the ingredients 
there are also vegetables. If you collect those you will loose life points. Additionally 
there are enemies: there are doctors who are placed on the map and tell the player how 
unhealthy cookies are. If a player touches a doctor he will loose life points. Furthermore 
if a player looses all of his life points he will also loose all of the collected ingredients. 
Next to the doctors there are also nurses. These are following the player and are trying to 
steal an ingredient of the player.
